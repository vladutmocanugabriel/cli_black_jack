\n#Number cards = Face value, Face cards (K, Q, J) = 10, Ace = 1 or 11.\
\n#Each player and the dealer get two cards (one dealer card is face-up).\
\n#Players can Hit (take another card) or Stand (keep their hand).\
\n#Dealer must hit until at least 17.\
\n#Blackjack (Ace + 10-point card) = Instant win unless dealer also has it (push).\
\n#Bust (over 21) = Automatic loss.\
\n#If neither busts, the higher total wins.\
\n#Blackjack pays 3:2, a regular win pays 1:1, and a tie (push) returns the bet."
